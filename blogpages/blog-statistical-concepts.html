                    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> A Type I error occurs when we incorrectly reject a true null hypothesis (false positive), while a Type II error happens when we fail to reject a false null hypothesis (false negative). Balancing these errors is crucial in hypothesis testing.</p>

                    <h3>Question 3: How do you interpret a p-value?</h3>
                    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> A p-value represents the probability of obtaining results at least as extreme as those observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true. A small p-value (typically less than the significance level, such as 0.05) suggests that the observed data is unlikely under the null hypothesis, leading us to reject it.</p>
